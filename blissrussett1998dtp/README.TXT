Make the most of your Zip drive.  Use Zip disks to:

 1.  Extend your hard disk (hard disk upgrade alternative).
     Are you constantly running out of hard disk space?  Your Zip
     drive and disks give you unlimited storage for all your
     information.  By placing files on Zip disks, you have ready
     access to them without filling up your hard disk.  Zip Tools
     software will help you find any files you need, and Zip
     drive's hard-disk-like performance will let you access
     information quickly.

 2.  Move information.
     Do you need to move information between different work
     locations?  Between home and work?  To and from clients? 
     Your Zip drive and disks offer complete mobility.  Zip disks
     fit in a shirt pocket; your Zip drive is easy to carry and
     quick to set up.  The Guest program allows you to use your
     Zip drive temporarily almost anywhere.

 3.  Back up your hard disk.
     Your Zip drive makes backups fast and simple.  You don't
     need special backup software   just copy critical files to a
     Zip disk.  Copying is lightning fast, and you end up with an
     exact duplicate of your original files.  If you need to
     restore a file, simply copy it back to your hard drive, or
     just access it directly from the Zip drive.

 4.  Create a multimedia library (images, sounds, and video).
     Because of their high capacity, removability, and random
     access, Zip disks are ideal for storage-hungry image, sound,
     and video files.  Clips can come from a variety of sources,
     including scanners, CD-ROMs, and video input devices.  You
     can create and store multimedia presentations and
     demonstrations, including video, that you can replay
     directly from the Zip disk.

5.  Archive your important records.
     Do you need to keep files for a number of years?  Archive
     your valuable files on a Zip disk and store them in a safe
     place.  Whenever you need them, you can access them quickly.

6.  Get organized.
     If you work on lots of different projects or with many
     different clients, try segmenting your work onto different
     disks.  You can organize your information by project,
     client, date, or whatever.  Zip disks give you the capacity
     to get all associated files onto a single disk.  Then,
     switching between projects and customers is as simple as
     inserting another Zip disk.

7.  Secure sensitive files.
     To keep sensitive or confidential information safe, store it
     on a Zip disk and use your Zip Tools software to assign a
     password that must be used in order to read from or write to
     the disk.  At work, you can protect sensitive information
     such as personnel files, company directories, and product
     plans and designs.  At home, you can secure personal
     information such as tax records, budgets, and computerized
     checkbooks.
