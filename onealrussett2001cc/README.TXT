There are five other files accompanying this introductory text:        

There are two files of data (io_tbl1.dta and io_tbl1a.dta), which were used to produce the results reported in Tables 1 and 2 of John R. Oneal and Bruce Russett, "Clear and Clean: The Fixed Effects of the Liberal Peace," International Organization, 2001, vol. 55,2 (Spring:469-85).  Both are in Stata 6.0 format.  The data in io_tbl1.dta were used for the analyses in columns 1 and 2, and io_tbl1a.dta contains the data for column 3.  The file iotable1.log contains all three analyses.

The file io_tbl3.dta has the data for the results reported in Tables 3 and 4.  The associated log file is iotable3.log.

See the article for detailed descriptions of the variables and the sources of the data.  The variable names in the dataset do not precisely match those in the article, but the proper correspondence can be determined by looking at the description of the variables and by comparing the log files to the tables.
