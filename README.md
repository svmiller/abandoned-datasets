# Miscellaneous Abandoned Datasets

These are data sets I've found that are perhaps necessary for replication, but not easily obtained, and might as well be abandoned. Reproducibility was not a strong norm in the discipline some 20 years ago or so. At most, you might get a `.sav` or `.dta` file on some faculty member's website (that is almost certainly no longer valid). If you're diligent at sleuthing, you can get it back.

## Contents Include (So Far)

    - Note: I had to feed this through an [online `.sav` converter](https://secure.ncounter.de/spssconverter) because the R packages I had for this didn't support this particular format.
